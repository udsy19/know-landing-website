## Slide 1: Title

**[know]**

*Network Intelligence Infrastructure*

Your team's relationships, one search away.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Cold outreach is dying. Teams can't find warm paths.

The average 10-person team has **20,000+ relationships** trapped in silos.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cold email response | 2% |
| Warm intro response | 68% |
| Time spent searching | 10+ hrs/week |
| Deals via warm intro | 34x more |

**Warm intros close 34x more deals.**
Teams can't find them at scale.

*Sources: Belkins 2025 (2% cold response), GrowLeads (68% warm response), LinkedIn Sales Solutions (34x deal conversion)*

---

## Slide 3: Why This Matters

### Statistics Grid

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Cold email response | 2% | Industry average |
| Warm intro response | 68% | Decision-makers |
| Wasted annually | $47B | On cold outreach |
| B2B deals via referral | 84% | Starting point |
| Close time | 3x faster | With referrals |
| CAC reduction | 40% | Via warm paths |

**34x more effective, but impossible to find at team scale**

*Sources: Belkins 2025, GrowLeads, ReferReach, LinkedIn Sales Solutions*

---

## Slide 4: The Insight

### The average 10-person team has:

| Asset | Volume |
|-------|--------|
| Emails | 500,000+ |
| Connections | 25,000+ |
| Searchable warm paths | 20,000+ |

**The Gap:**
- Data exists in isolated silos
- No way to search across team network
- Teams cold email people they're 2° from

**We make it searchable.**

---

## Slide 5: The Solution

### [know] turns team networks into searchable infrastructure.

**Search:** "VP of Engineering at Stripe"
**Result:** → 3 warm paths in 0.8 seconds

| Step | Function | Details |
|------|----------|---------|
| CONNECT | Data integration | Gmail/Outlook, Calendar, LinkedIn · 2 min/person |
| SEARCH | Natural language | Any role, company, criteria · Sub-second |
| GET INTRO | One-click | Warm path, strength score · 68% response |

From 10+ hours of manual searching to seconds of results.

---

## Slide 6: The Moat

### Why this becomes unbeatable infrastructure

| Moat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Team Network Effects** | More members = exponentially more paths. 10→25 people = 14x value (Metcalfe's Law) |
| **Proprietary Intelligence** | Relationship scores from behavior signals. 6 months = irreplaceable data moat |
| **Privacy-First Architecture** | Metadata only. Never read email content. SOC 2 compliant. Enterprise-ready |
| **Infrastructure Lock-In** | Teams integrate into workflows. Switching = rebuilding entire network graph |

**The first platform to make team relationship data instantly searchable infrastructure.**

## Slide 7: Market

### $16B+ TAM in US alone

**Bottoms-Up TAM:**
| Segment | Size |
|---------|------|
| Sales teams (13M professionals) | $12B |
| Recruiting teams | $1B |
| BD/Partnerships | $3B |
| **Total US** | **$16B+** |

Entry: Sales teams at $499/mo (5 seats) → 2.5M teams × $6K/year = $15B

**Market Validation:**
| Company | Metric |
|---------|--------|
| ZoomInfo | $1.21B revenue |
| Sales Navigator | ~$1.5B revenue |
| Apollo.io | $1.6B valuation |
| Affinity | $640M valuation |
| Clay | $1.25B valuation |

They sell contact data for **strangers**. We unlock relationships teams **already have**.

## Slide 8: Traction

**Pipeline:**

---

## Slide 9: Competition

### We're creating a new category. Not competing.

| Competitor | What They Do | Gap | Why We Win |
|------------|--------------|-----|------------|
| LinkedIn Sales Nav | Searches their database | Not YOUR network | Searches YOUR team's relationships |
| ZoomInfo / Apollo | Sells contact data | No warm paths | Finds warm intro paths instantly |
| Affinity | $500/seat enterprise CRM | Manual setup | $499/mo teams, zero setup |
| Clay | Enriches stranger data | Cold outreach only | Unlocks paths to people you know |
| Happenstance (YC W24) | Slack-dependent | Enterprise only | Works everywhere, any team size |

**Privacy-first (metadata only). Team network effects. Infrastructure-grade economics.**
